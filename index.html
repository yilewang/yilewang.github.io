	<h2 align="center"> About Me </h2>
	<p align="left";> My name is Yile (Wayne) Wang. Currently I am a Master student of Applied Cognition and Neuroscience Program in The University of Texas at Dallas, working at <strong>Brain Circuits Laboratory</strong> (PI: <a href="https://bbs.utdallas.edu/faculty/detail.php5?i=2036" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ana Solodkin</a>). Our lab is using TheVirtualBrain (<a href="https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei" rel="nofollow">TVB</a>) to do series of studies on clinical populations, including Alzheimer's, MCI, Parkinson's, etc. I do computational neuroscience research on brain dynamics, brain connectivity and brain simulation within TVB framework. Personally, I am interested in large-scale brain networks dynamics and its association with human's behavior and cognition. <br> <br> To know more about me, please see the <a href="blog/about"> about page</a> or my google scholar and twitter pages below. </p>
