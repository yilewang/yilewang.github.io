# Yile Wang

I am a computational neuroscience researcher working on understanding how neural networks learn, adapt, and represent information. My research combines tools from machine learning, statistics, and cognitive science to study representational drift, memory consolidation, and learning algorithms in both artificial and biological neural systems.

I use computational modeling and data-driven approaches to investigate how complex cognitive processes emerge from neural dynamics. My work focuses on developing interpretable models that can help us understand the mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain.

I am currently a PhD student in Cognition and Neuroscience at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I work on network dynamics, Hebbian learning algorithms, and models of representational drift. I received an M.S. in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience from UT Dallas and a B.S. in Southern Medical University.
