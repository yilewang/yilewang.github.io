Welcome! I study how neural systems represent information and adapt through experience. My current projects blend computational modeling with empirical datasets to uncover mechanisms of memory consolidation and flexible decision making.

On this site you can browse a concise CV, a list of publications, and selected posts that outline ongoing ideas and notes.

## Research snapshot
- Building recurrent models that link neural dynamics to behavior.
- Exploring memory-guided learning rules inspired by biological circuits.
- Writing short posts on papers, experiments, and reproducible analysis tricks.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about collaborations or mentoring opportunities.
