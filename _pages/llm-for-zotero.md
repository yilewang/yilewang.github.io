**llm-for-zotero** is a plugin for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) that integrates Large Language Models directly into the Zotero PDF reader. Unlike tools that require uploading PDFs to a web portal, this plugin lets you chat with your papers without leaving Zotero. It sits quietly in the reader sidebar, ready whenever you need it.

2. Paste your **API Base URL**, **secret key**, and **model name**.
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify.

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/model_setting.gif" alt="Provider and model configuration">

The plugin natively supports multiple provider protocols: `responses_api`, `openai_chat_compat`, `anthropic_messages`, `gemini_native`, and more.

### Supported Models (Examples)

| API URL | Model | Reasoning Levels | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses` | gpt-5.4 | default, low, medium, high, xhigh | PDF uploads supported |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses` | gpt-5.4-pro | medium, high, xhigh | PDF uploads supported |
| `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | deepseek-chat | default | |
| `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | deepseek-reasoner | default | |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-3-pro-preview | low, high | |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-2.5-flash | medium | |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-2.5-pro | default, low, high | |
| `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` | kimi-k2.5 | default | |

You can also set up **multiple providers**, each with multiple models for different tasks, such as a multimodal model for figures and a text model for summaries. Cross-check answers across models when you want broader coverage.

### Advanced: Reasoning Levels & Hyperparameters

You can set different reasoning levels per model in the conversation panel, such as `default`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`, depending on model support. You can also adjust hyperparameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens_output` for more creative or more deterministic responses.

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Open any PDF** in the Zotero reader.
2. **Click the LLM Assistant icon** in the right-hand toolbar to open the sidebar.
3. **Type a question** such as *"What is the main conclusion of this paper?"*

On the first message, the model loads the full paper content as context. Follow-up questions use focused retrieval from the same paper, keeping the conversation fast and relevant.

### Conversation Modes

The plugin supports multiple conversation contexts:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Paper conversation** | Chat about a specific open PDF. Context is drawn from that paper. |
| **Global conversation** | Library-wide chat, not tied to any specific paper. |
| **Note conversation** | Chat while editing a Zotero note, with note content as context. |

### Interface Controls

- **Model selector** — switch between configured models mid-conversation.
- **Reasoning selector** — choose the reasoning level for the current request.
- **Font scaling** — adjust sidebar font size from 80% to 180%.
- **Auto-scroll** — automatically scrolls to the latest message.
- **Token usage** — real-time display of input, output, and reasoning tokens consumed.

- **Limitations** — identify weaknesses or gaps

---

## Agent Mode (Beta)

<div class="rtd-warning">
  <div class="rtd-admonition-title">Important</div>
  Agent Mode is disabled by default. Enable it in <strong>Preferences</strong>, then toggle <strong>Agent (beta)</strong> in the context bar.
</div>

When enabled, the LLM becomes an **autonomous agent** that can read, search, and write within your Zotero library. It operates with a human-in-the-loop design — all write operations require your explicit approval before execution.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `query_library` | Search and list Zotero items, collections, related papers, and duplicates |
| `read_library` | Read metadata, notes, annotations, attachments, and collection details |
| `inspect_pdf` | Read front matter, search pages, retrieve evidence, inspect the active reader view |
| `search_literature_online` | Search live scholarly sources or fetch external metadata |
| `mutate_library` | Batch write operations such as metadata edits, tagging, collection changes, note writes, and imports |
| `undo_last_action` | Revert the last approved write batch |

The design philosophy is **fewer, more general tools** rather than a long list of task-specific ones. Ask the agent what it can do — it will tell you.

### Built-in Actions

The latest release emphasizes general tools over a fixed action menu. Common agent workflows include:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Inspect papers** | Read metadata, notes, annotations, and grounded PDF evidence |
| **Find related work** | Search your library or online scholarly sources for related papers |
| **Apply tags** | Draft tag changes for your approval before batch application |
| **Write notes** | Prepare notes or summaries tied to the active paper |
| **Undo changes** | Revert the most recent approved write batch |

### Agent Demos

#### Multi-step workflow

The agent can chain multiple tools together to accomplish complex tasks, such as finding a paper, reading its metadata, searching for related work, and writing a summary note.

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/agent/multi_steps.gif" alt="Multi-step agent workflow" style="max-width:512px;">

#### Read a figure directly

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/agent/single_figure.gif" alt="Agent reading a figure from the PDF">

#### Read multiple pages

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/agent/full_docs.gif" alt="Agent reading multiple pages">

#### Find related papers

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/agent/related_papers.gif" alt="Agent finding related papers">

#### Apply tags automatically

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/agent/apply_tags.gif" alt="Agent applying tags to a paper">

#### Write a note

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yilewang/llm-for-zotero/main/assets/agent/write_note.png" alt="Agent writing a note">

### Safety & Confirmation

All write operations go through a **human-in-the-loop confirmation** workflow:

- The agent proposes a batch of changes (e.g. add tags, edit metadata).
- You review the proposed changes in a rich approval form.
- You can **approve**, **reject**, or **modify** before any changes are applied.
- If something goes wrong, use `undo_last_action` to revert.

## Codex Auth Setup

If you have a **ChatGPT Plus** subscription, you can use **Codex auth** to access models like `gpt-5.4` without a separate API key. The plugin reuses your ChatGPT login via the Codex CLI.

_Special thanks to [@jianghao-zhang](https://github.com/jianghao-zhang) for contributions to this feature._

### Step-by-step setup

**1. Install the Codex CLI** (one-time):

```bash
# macOS / Linux (requires Node.js 18+)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# macOS alternative (no Node.js needed)
brew install --cask codex
```

**2. Log in with your ChatGPT account:**

```bash
codex login
```

A browser window opens — sign in with your ChatGPT Plus account. Credentials are saved to `~/.codex/auth.json`.

**3. Configure the plugin:**

In Zotero &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **llm-for-zotero**:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Auth Mode | `codex auth` |
| API URL | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` |
| Model | e.g. `gpt-5.4` |

Click **Test Connection** to verify.

<img src="/images/llm-for-zotero/codex.png" alt="Codex auth configuration">

### Technical Notes

- Reads local credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`).
- Automatically attempts token refresh on 401 responses.
- Embeddings are not supported in codex auth mode yet.
- Local PDF/reference text grounding and screenshot/image inputs are supported.
- The Responses `/files` upload + `file_id` attachment flow is not supported yet.

## MinerU PDF Parsing

**MinerU** is an advanced PDF parsing engine that extracts high-fidelity Markdown from PDFs while preserving tables, equations, figures, and complex layouts that standard text extraction often mangles.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yilewang/llm-for-zotero/main/assets/minerU.png" alt="Screenshot showing MinerU PDF parsing results in the plugin">

When enabled, the plugin sends your PDF to the MinerU API for parsing and caches the result locally. All later interactions with that paper reuse the MinerU-parsed content, giving the model richer and more accurate context.

### How to Enable MinerU

1. Open Zotero &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **llm-for-zotero**.
2. Find the **MinerU** section and check **Enable MinerU**.
3. Optionally enter your own MinerU API key.
4. Open any PDF and start chatting. The plugin will parse the PDF on first use and cache the result for later conversations.

### Using Your Own API Key

The plugin provides a shared community proxy so MinerU works out of the box without an API key, but the shared quota is limited. For heavier usage:

1. Go to [mineru.net](https://mineru.net) and create an account.
2. Generate an API key in your account settings.
3. Paste the key into Zotero &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **llm-for-zotero** &rarr; **MinerU**.
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify.

When a personal API key is provided, the plugin calls the MinerU API directly at `https://mineru.net/api/v4`. Without a key, it uses the community proxy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is it free to use?**

Yes, the plugin is completely free and open source (AGPL v3). You only pay for API calls to your chosen provider. With Codex auth, ChatGPT Plus subscribers can use their existing subscription without a separate API key.

**Does it work with local models?**

Yes. As long as the local model provides an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, you can connect it by entering the appropriate API Base URL and key in settings.

**Is my data used to train models?**

No. You use your own API key, so data privacy is governed by the terms of your chosen provider.

**How do I report a bug or request a feature?**

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/yilewang/llm-for-zotero/issues) on GitHub.
