Welcome to my academic homepage. I am a PhD student in Cognition and Neuroscience whose research interests span computational neuroscience, machine learning, and cognitive modeling. This site collects my publications, projects, talks, and teaching activities in one place.

When I am not running simulations or experiments, I enjoy building intuitive explanations for complex concepts and collaborating across disciplines. Feel free to explore the sections above or reach out if you would like to connect.
