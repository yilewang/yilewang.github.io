I am a computational neuroscience researcher working on understanding how neural networks learn, adapt, and represent information. My research combines tools from machine learning, statistics, and cognitive science to study representational drift and learning algorithms in both artificial and biological neural systems.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Cognition and Neuroscience program at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I work on Hebbian learning algorithms, and models of representational drift. I received an M.S. in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience from UT Dallas and a B.S. in Southern Medical University.
