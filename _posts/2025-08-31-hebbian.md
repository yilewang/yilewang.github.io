# Basic idea of Hebbian learning
Hebbian learning is a theory in neuroscience that explains how neural connections strengthen through repeated activation. The principle is often summarized as "cells that fire together, wire together." This concept has been influential in understanding synaptic plasticity and the mechanisms underlying learning and memory.
