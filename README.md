# Personal website built with AcademicPages

This site now uses the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, a Jekyll theme built on top of Minimal Mistakes. Content lives in collection folders such as `_publications`, `_projects`, `_talks`, and `_teaching`, while posts remain in `_posts`.

## Running locally
1. Install Ruby and Bundler.
2. Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
3. Serve the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Site-wide settings are defined in `_config.yml`, navigation links live in `_data/navigation.yml`, and custom styles can be added in `assets/css/main.scss`.
